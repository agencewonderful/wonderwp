# Generator

If you just want to get started quickly, you can use the generator plugin. It will ask you a few questions and will generate for you the folder structure as well as the required files to get started.

The good thing with a generator besides the fact that is makes you gain time, is that it ensures that the generated code follows the framework guidelines, naming conventions, indent and so one :)
